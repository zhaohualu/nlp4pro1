58	1	a	he is kind of dragging he is again he is not he has to be told over and over to do something did you get in the shower yet did you brush your teeth you know like you have to walk him through everything he is supposed to do before he goes to school because he is just not focusing on anything 
59	0	a	it is usually she either needs to take a nap and so she misses out on something or she pushes through so that she can participate and then she is really tired 
60	0	a	she just is you know moves slower and is more apt to lay down on the couch 
61	0	a	i guess the one time i can remember here recently was his travel team played in the they qualified for the world series and he played or games in i think days that just took a toll on him 
62	0	a	you can just tell if s wore out he is got a short fuse with him 
63	0	a	oh frustration a lot of frustration 
64	0	a	he will but it is just more of a change in attitude 
65	1	a	i think it makes it harder for her to focus and pay attention i think so then she gets less out of it and then she is less usually able to interact as much with her environment as she may if she was not fatigued 
66	0	a	also a tolerance level you know i see with her a lower tolerance level if she is fatigued as far as tolerating things that are upsetting or siblings or other kids it is emotional ability to deal with things when we are that tired it tends to make things that do not have to be a huge deal a bigger deal because i think we are just so overloaded that we are not able to process or not able to handle kind of the straw that broke the camels back 
67	0	a	but outbursts for her where she is not thinking before she is talking or not thinking of how she is interacting with people and that is usually when we will see that is when she is tired when she says she is not regulating herself as well or she is just tired and gets upset or angry quicker or things bother her more to where she does not get tearful very often but she might get tearful or she will talk about something that is upsetting her if she gets her feelings hurt more easily 
68	0	a	sometimes she is just kind of ill and cranky and um do not mess with me type of attitude 
69	0	a	but she does not go outside and do anything i do not know she just she just comes home and sleeps everyday 
70	0	a	and just involvement with her friends you know being so tired that she does not feel like getting out and going to hang out with them 
71	0	a	i would say um you know mood swings argue with momma a lot 
72	0	a	sometimes she gets real ornery and you can tell when she gets real ornery you know she is tired

74	0	a	like he is able to do like swimming he would not want to go swimming um ride his bike ride his board which he do not do anymore though 
75	0	a	he just laid around in the bed and watched tv 
76	0	a	slept all day he got up to get something to drink and then he went back to sleep 
77	0	a	it is kids that get and they are all tired like no i do not want to got to school and all that but at least they get out of bed and do that is really really hard to get out of bed 
78	0	a	chores 
79	0	a	but she tends to get the morning to sleep in but also the afternoons even when she was super tired 
80	0	a	she wants her blanket she moves slower will spend time with her cats definitely slows her down definitely 
81	1	a	she just had a hard time focusing it was difficult for her to do a good job with her work and she is a smart girl
