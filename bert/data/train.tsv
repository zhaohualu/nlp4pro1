71	0	a	normally i feel like when i get home i can go outside and usually i can ride my four wheeler afterschool and during the school year i can not because i am just so tired 
72	0	a	i feel like it is like you do not wanna do nothing just do nothing at all being weak or something 
73	1	a	like in school mostly 
74	0	a	yeah when i was tired i felt just lazy and just like wanting to lie down and just lazy 
75	0	a	i think i was with my dad or something it was outside and it was all day well not all day all day but just like in the morning 
76	0	a	like i want to play the guitar but then i do not wanna do nothing i just wanna lay down 
77	1	a	i just did not feel like thinking at all i just when i am tired i can not focus i can not think at all 
78	0	a	i kind of just stay in bed lay down not trying to walk around the house 
79	0	a	kind of moody 
80	0	a	like when i am trying to go to sleep and someones trying to wake me up i get all moody i guess 
81	0	a	very grouchy just tired 
82	0	a	yeah at times i would really want to go to school just to learn but when i am tired i would just rather keep sleeping and not really want to go 
83	0	a	because it is just i have if i do not get enough sleep it is it does not get me refreshed for the day and i just get mad that i have to wake up 
84	0	a	well being tired when i go to school i just feel like i want to go to sleep in the class and i start to doze off into my dreams and go to sleep but i just come right back 
85	0	a	yes i set my books down on the table and i just laid my head just because i felt good when i laid my head but then it just went dark and then i woke up and i realized that i had blacked out 
86	1	a	i hadnt really written down what i had to do for homework so the next day i had forgotten some of my homework 
87	0	a	because my legs and all my joints just felt weak and i just wanted to sit down 
88	0	a	like they were just kind of heavy to get a hold of description of weak 
89	0	a	well like i said i was upset that i did not get enough sleep 
90	0	a	it was a day that i stayed at home and i was basically working on a packet that i had to do for the summer while working on it i closed my eyes for a little and when i woke up it was late at night 
91	1	a	i could not solely rely on my brain because it was really hard to think so i had to use other things like a calculator and a piece of paper 
92	0	a	groggy brains not working 
93	1	a	not keeping a sharp keen eye on what you are saying 
94	1	a	my brain is not working to well for like math problems during school or answers that are completely wrong 
95	0	a	when i am tired i usually lay in bed more than normal i do not really want to move 
96	0	a	kind of a little bit disappointed in myself 
97	0	a	a little bit different from normal 
98	0	a	um it was like two weeks ago i was really tired and i had like a headache and it is just like really tired i could not do anything 
99	0	a	i just felt really lazy trying to get up and stuff and i did not wanna like get up and do some stuff 
100	0	a	like get up and take a shower 
101	0	a	or get up to get food 
102	0	a	like lazy did not wanna get up 
103	1	a	it was a little bit harder to pay attention because it hurts my head when people talk 
104	0	a	like make the bed and stuff chores around the house 
105	0	a	uhh yes last friday had a headache and i was really tired and i went home from school and lied down on the couch i had a stomachache and then come home from school and just really lied down on the couch 
106	0	a	uh we just watched tv and lied down 
107	0	a	tired lazy like did not feel too good in my stomach and my head 
108	0	a	uh concentrate on my work because i had a headache and the teachers were talking and stuff and the kids were so loud hurts your head 
109	0	a	playing outside running and stuff 
110	0	a	when i was like really tired and i did not feel like moving very much it affected me running and stuff i could not run as fast as i usually do 
111	1	a	and reading it hurt to like move my eyes and look at the paper that is really it 
112	0	a	you can not push through 
113	0	a	it just feel like that you need energy to me really that is it 
114	0	a	like once i am tired i just do not feel like talking and things like that 
115	0	a	if i am tired and exhausted and stuff i kind of do not feel like talking and laughing and having fun things like that and having fun 
116	1	a	um not really focusing and pushing through and things 
117	1	a	um like sometimes like when i can not focus you know i really can not explain that one 
118	0	a	um i started to get mad kind of because they wanted to take me out 
119	0	a	after school by oclock i am ready to lay in the bed and cuddle up and get in bed 
120	0	a	yes i am so tired 
121	0	a	i wake up i do not go to sleep really late i go to sleep around i guess i wake up in the morning i am still pretty tired 
122	0	a	by oclock i am ready to just pass out again because it is just school drains me i do not know why but it does 
123	0	a	it is most of the time 
124	0	a	i do not know why i would be physically tired because i do not really do much during the day but walk between classes and do my work 
125	0	a	by the end of the day i am just worn out mentally and physically and i do not know why to be honest that kind of puzzles me 
126	0	a	on a really busy day i get home and i literally go to bed 
127	0	a	i get home and i lay down and i cuddle up with my dogs and i go to sleep until probably oclock 
128	0	a	i think that going to sleep when i get home prevents me from going to bed earlier which keeps me up even anyway because it makes me even more tired when i wake up that morning 
129	0	a	when i finally do go to bed and so if i do take a nap then i probably wont go to bed until because i went to sleep earlier 
130	0	a	when i get sleepy i get kind of i would not say sad but i would say a little upset and everything kind of bothers me a little bit more than it would during the day 
131	0	a	say i was tired and it was the end of the day and i was about to go home and go to bed and they told me my shoes did not match my outfit i would be like well what does it matter i do not want to talk about it you know like i would snap i would get irritated and snappy 
132	1	a	it affects it a lot because sometimes i will be in class and it will be like kind of a boring day where we are just being reading in the book and i will get tired especially if it is first period and i will get sleepy and i can not focus on what i am reading sometimes 
133	1	a	i will be like trying to read something and i will be tired and my eyes will drift and i will completely lose my place and i just can not focus at all 
134	0	a	and when i am driving because i have drivers ed also whenever i am driving i usually have to ask the other person to drive because i will have time to wake myself up a little bit more 
135	0	a	so it means to me like when you are fatigued or tired basically when you just feel like you just need to lay down or sleep or you just feel like you do not want to go and do anything really 
136	0	a	sometimes when like you are tired you are sore or your maybe your body feels heavy 
137	0	a	maybe even when you are tired you might have a headache pain somewhere and you can be tired of the pain as well 
138	0	a	i know sometimes when i am too tired um there is days where like after school i might be too tired and so i just go home and i just sleep 
139	0	a	i do not feel like doing anything or going out anywhere or barely even leave my room at that 
140	0	a	it made me feel like i just wanted to stay still and not move at all barely even get up at that 
141	0	a	sometimes it can last maybe a couple hours until i get enough rest or sometimes it might even last like a couple days 
142	0	a	i mean i was feeling lonely but tired at the same time where i did not want to go out to do anything but i was lonely 
143	0	a	when i was thinking i was just like i should have went and i knew i would have a good time with them i just was too tired to go out and do anything 
144	1	a	at school like it is hard to like when you are taking notes sometimes my eyes slowly start shutting i got to try to wake myself up 
145	1	a	sometimes i am too tired to even do my schoolwork at times 
146	1	a	um normally i am working on my homework the next morning 
147	0	a	i would probably if i am tired i would tell you no not right now i am too tired maybe later another day 
148	1	a	too tired to do schoolwork in the same day 
149	0	a	it is mainly just like tired to go out anywhere 
150	0	a	like not really wanting to get up 
151	0	a	not being able to do what i normally would do or what i want to do 
152	0	a	like i got weight on my shoulders like there is something dragging me down 
153	0	a	like its just like there is this extra part of me that just wants to just lay down and go to bed 
154	0	a	sometimes i will just skip working out 
155	0	a	when i first started wrestling last year i just was always tired but i just think that was because i did not have the endurance for it but i got better after that 
156	0	a	like um not doing things that i would normally do like check on our like chickens or something 
157	1	a	well i had a hard time paying attention but i have always had a hard time paying attention to one thing for so long 
158	0	a	well over the summer i ended up getting a laminectomy on my back a laminectomy so i still wanted to golf and so i had to get those muscles back to the way that they used to be and so that was a real challenge for me and i worked every moment i could just trying to get better at golf 
159	0	a	i would just think to myself you are not giving up you have to finish this hole 
160	0	a	because with the leukemia i feel like i am sort of at a disadvantage like i havent gotten to play sports like every other kid so i feel like i am at that disadvantage and i just want to push myself to be better 
161	0	a	i mean first off i just think it is taking a nap just sleep 
162	0	a	i guess just mentally and physically overdrawn i guess 
163	0	a	usually just being tired to me is just wanting to take a nap or just go to sleep 
164	0	a	i do not know after i work out i am tired but then even after school i am tired 
165	0	a	i can think of one time when my brother and i were hiking we did fourteeners in a day and then so when i came back well i just crashed in the car and then i just came back and slept for you know until like in the morning 
166	0	a	well just that um by i guess by getting tired it is harder to move as fast and just be able to keep the speed up to get back i guess 
167	0	a	i guess like in the beginning of the day you are happy to be out there and then you realize it is pretty hard and then you start getting tired and you start getting less motivated and less wanting to do it i guess and then your mood changes and you just get more aggravated over little things 
168	0	a	from being like excited to be doing it to more so like alright how long will this be like can we just get down yeah like more just wanting to hurry up and be done 
169	0	a	so i had a paper last year and it was like a page paper and it was just stressful because i like well i had a subject but it was not quite as clear cut as i thought it was going to be so i had a lot more research and so i was staying up pretty late doing research and getting up early and so that for that like week there it was pretty tiring 
170	1	a	um well first off i was just struggling to stay focused during my other classes 
171	1	a	i was you know falling asleep or just kind of dozing off not dozing off but just kind of day dreaming not as with it as i normally was 
172	0	a	probably well just stressed and then a little bit sad i guess because i could not you know get on top of the ball and get it figured out 
173	1	a	i just was not or like where normally i would be focused and could kind of soak in the lectures or what the teacher was talking about i would be more daydream more or just kind of lose focus 
174	0	a	well like just hard to move around 
175	0	a	just wanting to sleep 
176	0	a	i just kind of feel bad because i miss out on a lot of stuff 
177	0	a	well usually i can not hang out with my family as much because i am just slowly walking around the house and stuff 
178	0	a	um i think i was most tired at my friends house cause i stood up all night 
179	0	a	horrible 
180	0	a	um it was just like a really slow walk 
181	0	a	i missed half of the day sleeping 
182	0	a	um i just kind of felt bad cause i was missing out on time with my family 
183	0	a	you know how in school i have to do a lot of work and like walk around and stuff and stressed and it makes me tired by the time i get home from school 
184	0	a	yes when i was very tired 
185	1	a	like schoolwork or after school activities like homework or stuff like that 
186	1	a	i probably just missed out on a lesson that the teacher was teaching 
187	0	a	just drained 
188	0	a	heavy 
189	0	a	it just felt like i just did not want to do anything i was just like giving up 
190	0	a	i would try to just not interact with them that much cause i am out here tired 
191	0	a	i did not really interact with them either i just went straight to my room and went to sleep 
192	1	a	i did not want to do my homework i really just did not want to do anything 
193	0	a	i just wanted to go to sleep and get some rest 
194	0	a	kind of well it was and stuff like that so i would just be emotionally and physically tired cause i am walking around and yelling and jumping and stuff like that 
195	1	a	hard because i was already like physically tired so 
196	0	a	me trying to go to sleep or something like to go to sleep 
197	0	a	it makes me feel like i have to i do not want to go to sleep but sometimes when i am tired i just want to play with my friends and stay up but i am really tired and i want to go to sleep 
198	0	a	yeah because i want to lay down in bed but i want to stay up with my friends because i do not want them to get mad and when they come i want to go to sleep when they come inside to play 
199	0	a	i did it two days ago and um my friends kept on saying that i should not go to sleep because they just got over and i kept on telling her i was really tired and she got mad and she asked her dad if she could go home because she was bored 
200	0	a	yeah because i really want to play but i was really super tired so it kind of made me mad 
201	0	a	i kept on telling her i was really tired so i fell asleep in the middle of my test and they woke me up and told me to do my test in the library so when you are tired it could really get you in trouble when you are at school 
202	0	a	it bothered me because like it hurts my eyes get wet when i stay up a lot and when i wake up early i am like in a bad mood 
203	0	a	i feel like i just want to go back to bed and i do not like getting up getting dressed and waking up early it makes me feel like when i go somewhere i just want to go to sleep 
204	1	a	yeah once i was getting something with my teacher and it was really important for our grade and i was frustrated because i was really tired 
205	0	a	sometimes when i am really tired it really aggravates me 
206	0	a	and i just have to go home and go to sleep 
207	0	a	i think about after school usually like i usually have to do homework and usually sometimes i help with supper help my mom and dad and i usually have to clean up after myself and after all that i usually get tired 
208	0	a	i feel lazy just do not feel like doing anything 
209	0	a	i remember on the of july my nana and papa got a water slide for us and i usually get tired after walking up the steps so i did a lot of playing and sometimes my cousins and my sisters and my brothers always want me to go back and play with them and sometimes i get tired and want to take a break but i usually play with them and then i take a break when they do 
210	0	a	i think about just being lazy and like to lay around and not to move or nothing 
211	0	a	i just sit in my bed and play on my phone and just do nothing 
212	0	a	when i hear about being tired like getting out of breath and like doing too much and like fatigue i am not percent sure 
213	0	a	out of breath lack of energy you know 
214	0	a	in basketball sometimes like when we have to run a drill like it could be like a two minute drill and then we would have to run like a little bit and then i would be like really tired 
215	1	a	i do not want to say like shut my brain down but like it did not make me think about like what to do cause we had like this really confusing drill and i could not remember it at all because we were running it and i did not remember it at all 
216	0	a	i think it was at practice basketball practice we were doing like school laps and she wanted us to do 
217	0	a	she wanted us to do like of them yeah 
218	0	a	like it made me like afterwards i could not like really say like a full full sentence like i could not just keep on repeating like i would have to take a breath to finish my words 
219	0	a	he will sleep a lot 
220	0	a	we will jump into the car and by the time we hit the highway he is half asleep but he does not say he is tired he just sleeps a lot 
221	0	a	we go hiking usually after we are done hiking he is usually tired after that yeah 
222	0	a	taking a nap 
223	0	a	i may walk by his room and he is just lying in bed or he may be sitting on the couch and he is just he is not playing with anything he is just sitting on the couch and just kind of i do not know just like vegging out you know not doing anything 
224	0	a	he is just he is quiet like i said he just simply does not do anything he does not and usually i know that the reason why he is being you know just i do not that is kind of hard to explain 
225	0	a	he just simply does not do anything he is not moving or anything 
226	1	a	yeah he does not focus on anything he does not try to 
227	0	a	and then he will fall asleep in class 
228	1	a	he will have trouble focusing or paying attention in class because for him when he gets tired he just as i said he just simply zones out so on those occasions that he is either gets up too early in the morning or he goes to sleep too late at night then he will have trouble focusing in the morning because he goes to class and he zones out the way he does when he is tired 
229	0	a	times when he does not get enough sleep the night before if he stays up too late then when it is time to get up for school or he will get up early in the morning and he has not had a full nights sleep so then he will be tired the next day at school 
230	0	a	it only happens when he stays up too late if he gets up too early it is okay because he is awake but then by the time he gets to class that is when he starts showing signs of like maybe by the time period period comes around that is when he starts dragging 
231	0	a	he gets even slower when he is tired 
232	0	a	so there is lots of times when she is been really really tired and um and we are her one of the reasons why she is online homeschooling is so that if she is not feeling well and she needs to sleep she can do that and she can watch because the classes are live but they are also then recorded 
233	0	a	if she needs to sleep she needs to sleep 
234	0	a	yeah yeah um and she may not feel like um talking with her friends as much until she gets rested and back up again 
235	0	a	go to bed a little bit earlier and sleep a little bit later 
236	1	a	well when she is tired of course it is harder for her to do her school work so even if she is able to you know participate in all her classes then you know sometimes when you are tired you may not be able to absorb information as well 
237	0	a	well a little bit more on um a little bit more raw a little easier for her little sister to irritate her 
238	0	a	smaller things uh irritate her more when she is tired 
239	0	a	i mean he is tired quite a bit after those activities 
240	0	a	and every once in a while he will lay around 
241	0	a	you know his legs were tired did not really want to get up and go outside and play and that is just not like him 
242	0	a	i just think mentally he was just wore out 
243	0	a	but he just really did not want to do too much other than lay around for a few days 
244	0	a	uh he gets grouchy yes if he is tired and wore out he is a little more chippy with his brother 
245	0	a	but when he is tired it is just like the same way with his brother you know and i we never argue but sometimes he tries to talk back every once in a while to his mom 
246	0	a	so he was pretty low energy the other day 
247	0	a	i would say he was not really focused very well 
248	0	a	so he you know i mean there are times when he will be like it is too hot and i am tired 
249	1	a	he is you know having a hard time focusing and kind of like looking off like he is not interested you know kind of like does not want to pick up his pencil and he just kind of like sits there and looks at you like what 
250	1	a	i think he does have problems sometimes with concentrating in those type of things 
251	1	a	sometimes you know like multi step directions or whatever obviously if he is if it is been a long day or something he tends to be worse at that kind of thing 
252	0	a	he gets you know frustrated really easy 
253	0	a	i think uh i think it affects his activeness as far as with him being a teenager um you know just really being an active teenager you know in different you know say different activities and things like that 
254	0	a	he is one that will get up and go and you know kind of go with us but i can just think of a time where he was just extremely tired to where he did not you know he did not want to go he just wanted to you know stay home and just sit in front of the game and play his game 
255	0	a	he stayed 
256	0	a	and you know he is used to being up and kind of being but he is more in his room watching tv or playing games or something like that rather than being you know having that drive to you know want to keep pushing you know for the team or wanting to keep pushing for this and that 
257	0	a	um but i think it affects his activeness 
258	0	a	as it relates to when i think of that it usually is just a profound tiredness you know that affects a persons ability to function within you know and interact with their world and feel well while doing so 
259	0	a	first of all it makes it hard to enjoy life you know to really enjoy what you are doing when you are very fatigued 
260	1	a	but it is not an uncommon occurrence at all for her to be too fatigued to do her homework or to complete it or to stay up as late as she would need to do it and there is been multiple occasions during which i have to tell her okay no we are done you need to go to bed you are tired you are going to get sick and then i had to send an email to the school and say you know she did homework from the time she got home until whatever time she just she is not functioning anymore 
261	0	a	being able to you know do something with her siblings or spend time with my sister who lives in arizona 
262	0	a	but when we talked about it she was tired so instead of coming in and being able to start on homework which she wanted slash did not want to do but she need to do she had to go in and go to bed and then she slept until it was time for us to get up and go to a veterans program that we had to go to 
263	0	a	or there is been times when she said ugh i am just too tired you know i think a lot of times she does not have a lot of friends at school but she is one of kids here that range from to so the kids might be outside playing basketball or something and there is times that she is just too tired that she does not have the energy to do it 
264	0	a	emotionally the biggest thing change is when she does not get rest typically that is when things bother her a lot more and where we might see an outburst and i mean she is a good kid so when i say i am using the term outburst in a very loose sense outburst is like hollering at her sister or you know using the sarcastic snotty teenager voice 
265	0	a	so it just is you really see it get to her heart things get to her heart more when she is more fatigued 
266	0	a	i am not as fast i can not run as long i get tired more easily i can not run as far and particularly with her younger sister who is i think it is hard for her when she sees i think that can be frustrating and it is hard for her to she has to remind herself that there is differences there that she can not control 
267	0	a	and so she is more her being tired is more of a physical tired and it is because her bodys not um it is not you know used to the exertion necessarily so i think a lot of hers is a physical tired 
268	0	a	well when she is had a really bad day like that at school and she feels drained um you know and she just what she would consider worn out or whatever where it is just a lot of activities and and things going on she will come home and want to you know lie down for a while 
269	0	a	she will come home though after school and go right to sleep and she will sleep pretty much until she will get home about little after and she will sleep i get home at between and and she is just not waking and this is like everyday 
270	0	a	she just says she is tired 
271	0	a	just irritable 
272	0	a	she is sleeping and even when she gets up and you tell her to do something she is still not i guess energy no energy to do it 
273	0	a	she is she is just very irritable and mean hateful like to me and to her sisters 
274	0	a	tired being performing daily chores 
275	0	a	coming in from school going to bed at a decent hour okay and then coming in from school and then going to back to sleep 
276	0	a	being able to get up around the house being too tired and not doing it 
277	1	a	the main thing is being worried about her being tired and going to school and not being able to concentrate on schoolwork 
278	0	a	she plays several sports with the school and um i am sure that you know showing up at practice being tired already you know i am sure that has a big involvement 
279	0	a	i would say extremely tired would be playing softball games friday night all day saturday night and then playing all day sunday and coming in out of the heat and being wore out 
280	0	a	well you know coming in and doing anything really she is wore out from that and it is hard for her to get do anything she is ready to conk out 
281	0	a	but you are right it does make everyone tired you know i would um but um yea just performing a lot of stuff 
282	0	a	just being irritable when you are tired 
283	0	a	like i said she is the only daughter and she is kind of ornery sometimes i am sure you know being tired brings it on a little bit 
284	0	a	she fights through it i mean like i said she will come home and go right to bed we will come in from work and i will have to wake her up for dinner 
285	0	a	well just i do not know if they are problems but just mobility if she wants to go do something buts she is too tired to go do it 
286	0	a	the next thing you know she is over here snoring 
287	0	a	just snappish remarks 
288	1	a	well it is just like i said when she comes in tired from something like that it is really what she wants to pay attention to she will pay attention to if she does not then she will lose focus and do something else 
289	0	a	she says i just really do not feel like going over there because i am so tired 
290	0	a	the only thing i can think of is she had mono back in august and was very tired 
291	0	a	she just moved kind of slow 
292	0	a	she was just weak 
293	0	a	fatigued 
294	0	a	i think she was just kind of disappointed that she did not feel well enough to get out and play and go to school and her usual routine 
295	1	a	i do not know if she could have functioned you know did go to school if she could have paid attention just because you know just from just being exhausted 
296	0	a	when we went to fall fest there is a something fall fest down here and we stay in a cabin for the weekend so there is a parade and all that and i mean he did not want to go one time to the parade and he rides you know a fire truck in the parade and then he did not want to go to the lake afterwards 
297	0	a	i mean he would get up and like go to the bathroom but he just was real slow and dragging his feet 
298	0	a	when i tried to get him up and make him go aggravated 
299	0	a	hollering he just was not going he was tired 
300	0	a	and after he has a seizure he is really tired but i do not think that you know of course that is normal 
301	0	a	he did not even want to get up and go 
302	0	a	yeah he had a really big big seizure right when christmas this past year came and he had it that morning and he slept all day 
303	0	a	because i was going to go christmas shopping and i had to leave him with my mother in law and he slept all day 
304	0	a	um when i got there i went to sleep for about two more hours and then i made him get up and he was groggy and put him in the truck and he went back to sleep and we drove minutes home he was sleep got him up when we got home got him in the house and put him in the bed for the night 
305	0	a	real slow just like literally wanting to fall asleep walking 
306	0	a	like getting up all kids are tired when they get up his is like way worse 
307	0	a	and he is ten times worse at waking up like getting up and going to school i mean like i did not realize how bad it was until i started you know doing my niece and my nephews too 
308	0	a	he will get aggravated if you keep saying come on you have had your jeans in your hands for minutes 
309	0	a	oh he is aggravated he hollers and stomps at you and when he is walking out 
310	0	a	um it does affect him getting up and getting dressed 
311	0	a	this past spring she got really really tired and it was after a lot of dance a lot of rehearsals lots and lots and lots 
312	0	a	yeah because she would need the weekends she would want to sleep in she was tired 
313	0	a	she missed little things like going to coffee with us we are a big family our familys real close even the ones out of town you know she would miss out on morning things miss out on church cause she wants to sleep in 
314	0	a	so she would miss out on some things 
315	0	a	i think it would have been more doing things with family during those hours when she wanted to sleep in not so much in the evening 
316	0	a	if she had an afternoon off she wanted to be home and just wanted to relax at home with her cats she did not want to be running around and so i had to understand that she was very vocal about i need time at home because she is gone so much 
317	0	a	she missed a couple of things with friends that she did not want to miss but she did and then sometimes she would go ahead and go but then maybe not go as long 
318	0	a	probably did yeah because there is some events she would have missed not a lot and a few events she would have missed 
319	0	a	it makes her frustrated sometimes angry a little bit of short tempered but those go in waves that is not like all the time she would have little bursts of it 
320	0	a	i would not say withdrawn cause she is gonna say exactly what she thinks not withdrawn in that sense but she is definitely gonna want to watch more t v she wants when she gets super super tired she will have these faces and she will have that and that is happened in the past too she will want to sleep more and it will make her want to rest more and it slows her down 
321	0	a	taking longer to finish not doing as well sloppy and so we are gonna take all that into consideration too this coming year looking at her schedule 
322	0	a	when she gets to those phases when she is really tired then i see an affects her it may affect her i do not know cause they text a lot and call each other and make plans and everything so it may affect her in other ways too that i see when she gets to the really tired phase is when i notice it more 
323	0	a	it was the same thing where she was exhausted only it was during holidays so she could sleep all she wanted and so it made her tired wanted to sleep in cause she worked worked worked worked she worked really hard and then after the performance she crashed so i will let her rest let her sleep and sort of catch up on it if you can and get well because she had caught something 
324	1	a	she is unable to stay awake in the afternoons like after school she is unable to complete homework assignments without frequent redirection to stay awake 
325	0	a	she will change her mind about being social at times if it is fresh on her mind she will say i want to do it but if it is around or oclock i see her energy levels drop 
326	0	a	i would say missing out on activities that she is possibly looked forward to 
327	0	a	she gets aggravated 
328	0	a	midday early evening if it is not done or she will say i want to stay home or i would rather go home than participate in activities 
329	0	a	so we were supposed to go shopping and she love justice so she said mom i want to go to justice and i said okay we are going to go to justice today but around oclock we went to go and she is like no mommy i just want to go home and it is only oclock 
330	0	a	she will probably fall asleep in the car on the way home when she gets home she is just kind of quiet in her room laying down 
331	0	a	i guess just missed opportunities she is not a complainer so if i would push her and i give them options you want to go home or what do you want to do she will not say anything she will just kind of sleep in the car 
332	0	a	she moves slowly 
333	1	a	i guess we are having to move to different places in the house because she gets restless and she loses focus so i may move her from the kitchen counter to the table or try to set her up somewhere in a room just to keep the atmosphere the environment different a little stimulating for her 
334	0	a	she is really aggravated she does not want to be bothered 
335	1	a	she is forgetful 
336	1	a	she will forget her chores and they have a routine but if she is tired she will forget to do things that she normally does in routine 
337	0	a	she may seclude herself she is gets very secluded
